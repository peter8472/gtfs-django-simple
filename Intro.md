# Introduction #

I need to learn django, and I also heard you can't get a job unless you have some code out there... fine, whatever.  I have long kept my coding to myself but I guess those days are over.

Google Transit no longer works on old phones.  This will allow me to see bus arrival times given a stop number, date/time, and bus line.

Since I'm not qualified to lead a project, I suggest you just fork it.  I'll try to keep the code readable and modular so you can just grab the stuff that you want.
